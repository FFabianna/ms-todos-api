## üê≥ Docker Image

The service uses the Node.js 8.17.0 image as the base. It:

1. Sets up the working directory.
2. Installs dependencies from `package.json`.
3. Exposes port 8082 (default API port).
4. Starts the server using `npm start`.

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment

- Deploys one replica of the container with the label `app: todosapi`.
- Exposes the container internally using a `ClusterIP` service on port 8082.
- Sets an environment variable for `ZIPKIN_URL` to enable distributed tracing.

## üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions automate:

1. Checkout and tag based on commit SHA.
2. Login to Azure and ACR (Azure Container Registry).
3. Build and push the Docker image to ACR.
4. Apply Kubernetes deployment and service configuration.
5. Update the deployment image with the newly pushed version.

## üì¢ Slack Integration

A secondary GitHub Actions workflow notifies a Slack channel when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. This helps keep the team informed of updates in the `ms-todos-api` microservice repository.
